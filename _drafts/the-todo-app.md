title: The To Do App
author: Stefan Mitev
excerpt: Description
---

Hello! This is the first in a series of posts for building a simple To Do web app. I picked this "overused" but simple app because it will allow us to focus on the architecture and technologies without going too deep into business logic complexities. The first objecive of this tutorial is to build modular and extensible architectural design.

After we have built this app, we will try to convert it to another technology stack while trying to maintain the good architectural design principles built in here. Next would be to compare the two approaches, the pros and cons while trying to port the app and conclude the challenges. These comparisons would be subjective of course, but I will allow you to discuss on the topic and give your opinion. It will be interesting to see your thoughts on the topic in the discussion thread at the end of this tutorial.

### Assumptions

Just biefly I will walk you trough the technical topics discussed in this tutorial. In this post I will layout the requirements, assumptions and architectural design. I will give you an overview of the first technology stack and some links for brushing-up your skill set. I assume that you know some programming and web technologies like JS, HTML, CSS (well, I think you came here because you already know something, right?). At the end I will give brief overview of the next post following this one. So...
